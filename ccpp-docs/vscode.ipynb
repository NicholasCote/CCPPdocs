    "[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) is a free open source code editor from Microsoft that runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It has a wide variety of capabilities and extensions available that make it very powerful software development tool. One of the extensions that can be installed is the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). This documentation will go over how to install the extension and configure VS Code to run on your local machine, while creating and executing the content on a remote JupyterHub system. "
