    "In order to utilize GitHub actions a directory named ***.github*** needs to be created in the base directory of the repository.\n",

    "The workflow itself is a [***yaml***](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) file that defines the actions that [trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow) and execute what is required for the continuous integration application. \n",
