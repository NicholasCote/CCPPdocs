<p>CISL is currently deploying a <strong><em>pilot</em></strong> on-premise prototype cloud environment for compute and storage.</p>

<p>2i2c is <strong><em>potentially</em></strong> going to deploy a JupyterHub instance in AWS for us as well. 
We would utilize this experience to leverage 2i2c knowledge for our own education.</p>

<h2 id="on-premise-cloud">On-premise cloud</h2>

<p>An on-premise (on-prem) cloud consists of storage, compute, and networking resources hosted on fully redundant hardware installed in personal/organizational facilities available to users</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-k8s">Kubernetes (k8s)</h3>
<p>We will utilize a k8s cluster to host JupyterHub. Dask will be installed to enable parallel computing. A JupyterHub Spawner will create single user environments with access to a shared and personal storage space. The Spawned user environments will come in different sizes with a GPU option.</p>

<p>k8s can also be used to host containers or containerized virtual machines for individual use cases.</p>

<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<h4 id="glade">GLADE</h4>
<p>NFS will be utilized to provide at least RO only access to GLADE on the Spawned JupyterHub user environments.</p>

<h4 id="stratus">STRATUS</h4>
<p>S3 will be provided via CISLs object storage platform <a href="https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/70549594">STRATUS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2i2c">2i2c</h2>
<h4 id="jupyterhub">JupyterHub</h4>
<p>2i2c will <strong><em>potentially</em></strong> deploy a JupyterHub instance in AWS. Access to this JupyterHub instance will be provided by GitHub Teams.</p>

<h4 id="storage-1">Storage</h4>
<p>Data Storage for the 2i2c JupyterHub instance is provided by AWS Elastic File System (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/">EFS</a>)</p>

<h2 id="data-access">Data Access</h2>
<p><a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/">AWS S3 Open Data Registry</a> utilizes AWS S3 API calls the same way as STRATUS. By utilizing S3 API calls we can make Data accessible in a familiar way on the Web and on-premise.</p>

<h2 id="agile-program-management">Agile Program Management</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://jira.ucar.edu/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=220&amp;projectKey=CCPP">Kanban Board</a></strong></p>

<p>This project is implementing a hybrid Agile Project Management workflow. Waterfall techniques will be used for high level project management. Kanban will be used for day to day tasks and creating a continuous flow of value to users.</p>
